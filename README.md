## Scala OOPs Assignment 2

Made a trait **queue** which performs two functions of insertion and deletion.


*(i) Two classes: **DoubleQueue** and **SquareQueue** mix in this trait.


*(ii) Used List for the implementation and made methods **enqueue** & **dequeue** methods for insertion and deletion respectively alongwith **printQueue** method to display queue as list

**DoubleQueue** enqueues the element after doubling them


**SquareQueue** enqueues the element after squaring them


**dequeue** method will remove the first element from the queue and has concrete definition in trait **queue**.
